= Overview - v1.1 =

This is a work-in-progress for documenting how tools in the toolbar should be designed so that they are accessible (color choices, minimal flashing & animation, configurable events), scalable (GM can choose any number of tools from a palette of those available no matter how many), and extendable (new templates require a minimal of coding and no changes to MapTool code).

== Document TODO ==

. ðŸ”² Add example(s) of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern:[Prototype pattern] to `ToolPlugin`.
. ðŸ”² Add methods for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern[Memento pattern] to `ToolPlugin`.
. ðŸ”² Add notes about how a generic Bean editing API will change the state on either:
.. The prototype object (thus changing defaults for future instances), or
.. The active instance (changing the defaults just for the drawing/template under construction).
. ðŸ”² Templates should typically snap to grid intersections or grid cells:
.. Gridless maps will (obviously!) default to creating gridless templates (`Shift` to draw a gridded template?).
.. Maps with a grid will default to cell-filling templates (`Meta` to turn off snap-to-grid?).
.. What to do when a gridless map adds a grid, or vice versa?
. ðŸ”² Some implementation details will need to be worked out:
.. The MapTool server will need to deliver plugin code to clients, not unlike how Add-ons currently work.
+
MapTool already implements the `cp://` URLStreamHandler for accessing resources that are in the (local) CLASSPATH.
What if that could be extended to include the server?
That would delay the download until such time as the toolbar is accessed, but a background MapTool thread could begin loading tools as soon as the main campaign is done loading and bandwidth is available.

.. GM will choose the toolbar options for their campaign.
+
Will users have their own "local" configuration as well?  Opinions, please! ;)

.. Drawings and templates should be sent to clients in real-time.
.. The player name should appear at the origin of the template, just as it does when moving a token.

== Class Diagrams ==

This first diagram provides an overview of how this redesign might progress.

It shows that all drawings and templates will be implemented as JavaBeans.
This allows for an automated and consistent UI where users can define the defaults of each tool without any coding being necessary.

It also shows the measurement tool being a subclass of the pointer tool.
In the final design, this may or may not be the case -- there is some overlapping functionality between the two, but whether they should be related is a separate question that this document is not attempting to answer.
It is displayed this way only to demonstrate the structure.

Note that the `ToolPlugin` provides methods for supporting the operations of the various tools.
Again, this is merely for discussion purposes; a completely different design may end up being chosen.

Many of the methods shown in these sample classes return `void`.
It is expected that the various plugins will use exceptions when errors occur and the plugin architecture within MapTool to catch all exceptions.

I'm not sure how the plugins should be "activated" when the user selects a toolbar icon.
On one hand, the tool could "grab" the mouse and keyboard so that all input events go through the tool.
That provides maximum flexibility for the tool and the ability to use any keystroke, mouse, or gesture activity as it wishes.
This might be good for accessibility as users could set these values as they want.

On the other hand, blocking events from the rest of MapTool seems extreme.
The tools will need to register for events in a way that might prevent them from being delivered to other components.
Again, I'm not sure about this, but it seems that perhaps menu options or macro buttons shouldn't be available while drawing a template...?
Or perhaps input events are registered in a "stack" and the various tools add their own listeners on top of that stack.
When the tool is done, those listeners are "popped" off of that stack.
Perhaps this is done by the Zone implementing the stack?
That allows other parts of the UI to still be used (like menu options), but those actions should probably terminate any active tool when they are invoked.

One aspect that this document doesn't address yet is _undo_/_redo_ capability.
It's critical that the typical undo ability work properly in this regard.
(It's been broken since the very early days and Sun's `UndoManager` doesn't make it easy to fix.)
The obvious undo/redo design would be to implement the _Command_ pattern and keep a stack of those objects.
So while undo/redo isn't explicitly discussed herein (yet), keep in mind that the completion of any given tool should generate a _Command_ object that is pushed onto a stack that MapTool is maintaining.

The diagrams below show how an actual implementation will likely be
structured.
Essentially, a plugin will include one or more tool implementations.
Plugins can be loaded dynamically and add themselves to a named group, or the user can assign a given plugin name to a given group.
Groups will be used to make quick and easy changes to the toolbar.

For example, five plugins for templates could be loaded.
They could self-assign themselves to the "D&D 5e" group.
(Such a group will be created if it doesn't already exist.)
Then the user can select that group to appear in the toolbar.
However, the user could also load template plugins from an alternate source and manually assign that template to the same group.
(Or, they could choose not to assign it to the "D&D 5e" group, but simply drag
and drop it to the toolbar.)

The distinction between using a group is both use-based and implementation based.
Groups are likely to be used together, so it should be easy for the user to select the group they way.
However, house rules may cause a GM to vary from a given implementation.
They may find that the implementation of a given template from a different
game system matches their interpretation more closely.

When templates are added automatically to a group, if the user has selected the contents of the group for the toolbar, those additions should automatically be added.
In other words, selecting a group means new updates automatically appear.
If individual templates are added to the toolbar, when other templates within that template group are updated, they will not automatically be added to the toolbar.

The idea is that any new plugins that want to implementation a new type of `Drawing` will create their own "implementation" component which subclasses `DrawingTool`.
It's likely that all drawings that support a particular type of map will be in a single implementation (for example, forest scenes might all be in one component).
That is not required at all, but it makes sense to implement them within a group as the `Drawing` groups will be added to the toolbar as described above.

It is not required that all classes in an implementation component be directly
inherited from `DrawingTool`, though.
It's certainly possible (and even likely) for there to be one or more abstract classes within the implementation component that actual implementation classes would subclass.

The `Template` component works analagous to how the `Drawing` component works.
It does have additional methods, as it needs to declare which game system the template is designed for, along with tooltip hints and so on.
A lot of the the other methods are shared with the `Drawing` family of tools, so should likely be factored out as long as there is a common implementation.
